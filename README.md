# UTRIP

This project, developed in three distinct phases, introduces a sophisticated web interface for a hotel reservation system. The implementation process was divided into the following key phases:

## Phases

**Phase 1: Data**
In this initial phase, the project focused on handling and organizing data. Robust data management forms the foundation of the entire system, ensuring seamless operation.

**Phase 2: Domain**
The second phase delved into the domain-specific logic, enhancing the system's capabilities and aligning it closely with real-world hotel reservation scenarios. Domain-specific rules and requirements were meticulously implemented.

**Phase 3: Service**
The final phase concentrated on building the service layer, where the logic was encapsulated into services, facilitating efficient communication between the user interface and the underlying data.

## How to Use

To access the web interface, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the web server application.
3. Open your web browser and enter the provided server address.
4. Start using the hotel reservation system through the interactive web interface.

## Technologies Used

- **APHTTP Library:** The web server is implemented using the APHTTP library, simplifying the process of handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **HTML:** The user interface is designed using HTML, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

## Installation

To run the web server locally, make sure you have the APHTTP library installed. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install aphttp
```
